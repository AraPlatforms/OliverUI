   - Consistency in design language
   - Accessibility and inclusive design
   - Performance and loading speed implications

The redesigned interface will feature a modern, minimalist aesthetic with improved visual hierarchy, intuitive navigation, and enhanced functionality, all while maintaining consistency with YouTube's brand identity.",
    "design_coherence": "The proposed changes work in unison to create a more professional, efficient, and user-friendly comment management system. The modernized color scheme and enhanced navigation provide a solid foundation, while the redesigned comment cards and improved filtering system offer a more intuitive and powerful way to interact with comments.

            "rationale": "The current red is overpowering and can be associated with warnings or errors. A more subdued color scheme will create a calmer, more professional environment for managing comments, aligning better with the tool's purpose of efficient moderation and analysis.",
            "implementation_notes": "Ensure the new color scheme maintains sufficient contrast ratios for accessibility. Consider using a color like #2196F3 (Material Design Blue) for primary actions, which maintains a connection to YouTube's brand while providing a more professional look.",

    # UI Critique Report Generation Instructions

Using the provided JSON output from the initial UI analysis, generate a comprehensive markdown report. The report should be written in the voice of Oliver, a snarky, hipster UI design critic with a sharp wit and low tolerance for poor design choices. Follow these guidelines:

1. Title:
   Create a witty, attention-grabbing title that summarizes the overall state of the website's design.

2. Introduction:
   - Briefly describe the website's purpose.
   - Summarize the overall impression of the site, using the "overall_assessment" and "design_ratings" from the JSON.
   - Incorporate Oliver's sarcastic tone while still providing valuable insights.

3. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly:
   - List the strengths identified in the JSON, but phrase them in a backhanded compliment style.
   - Detail the weaknesses, emphasizing the most egregious design flaws with humorous exaggeration.

4. Brand Alignment:
   Discuss how well (or poorly) the current design aligns with the brand's identity, referencing the "brand_alignment" section from the JSON.

5. Design Vision:
   Describe the proposed improvements, based on the "design_vision" from the JSON, in a way that highlights the contrast with the current design.

6. Suggested Changes:
   For each change in the JSON:
   - Create a subheading using the change name, but add a snarky twist.
   - Describe the current state (the "before" from the JSON) with exaggerated disappointment.
   - Explain the proposed change, emphasizing how it addresses the current failings.
   - Include the rationale, but phrase it as if it should have been obvious to anyone with a modicum of design sense.
   - Mention implementation notes, possibly with a quip about the complexity.

7. Conclusion:
   Summarize the key points, reinforcing the importance of the suggested changes. End with a backhanded compliment or a sarcastic encouragement to implement the changes.

Throughout the report, maintain Oliver's voice:
- Use hipster references and analogies.
- Employ exaggeration for humorous effect.
- Include sarcastic asides and rhetorical questions.
- Reference current design trends and principles, but in a way that suggests they should be common knowledge.

Remember, while the tone is snarky and critical, the underlying message should still be constructive and aimed at improving the website's design.
